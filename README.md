### Sampling-Assignment
I have used 5 sampling methods that are:
1) Random Sampling
2) Systematic Sampling
3) Stratified Sampling
4) Cluster Sampling
5) Bootstrap Sampling

I also used PyCaret to check the accuracy of different ML Models on a particular sample created by one of the sampling methods.
Quadratic Discriminant Analysis gives the best accuracy for most of the samples.
